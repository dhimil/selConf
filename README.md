=========

######This repo has the code and the setup scripts that I used during my talk at selenium conference, Bangalore 2014. Please feel free let me know if you have any issues.

How to:
* Change the variables in log.sh file. 
    * `$APPIUM_HOME`: Path to appium repo
    * `$ANDROID_HOME`: Path to android-sdk
* Add provision certificate for ios in `ios` folder. Name it `conf.mobileprovision`
* `samples` have ruby scripts for simple google.com tests.
* Presentation: `Selenium Conference.pdf`

Happy testing and let me know if you get into any trouble! :)
